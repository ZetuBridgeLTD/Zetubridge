I want to build a website called ZetuBridge. In this site people will be able to download the my apps that I'll publish  for now I have one app for Kenya Medical Training College students called Medical Archives (MED-A);

Android app: MED-A, Welcome to MED-A! Your go-to app for accessing past exam papers from Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC). Whether you're a KMTC student or enrolled in a private institution offering courses like nursing and more, MED-A is here to support your studies with valuable resources to help you succeed.

Download url inside the button: https://apk.e-droid.net/apk/app3179519-tbdlv2.apk?v=7


The logo of the app is: https://res.cloudinary.com/dtjjgiitl/image/upload/q_auto:good,f_auto,fl_progressive/v1751888222/xaygpw2rzfihfhggjm5b.jpg

..This is a screenshot of a girl holding a phone that displays Med-A App (https://res.cloudinary.com/dtjjgiitl/image/upload/q_auto:good,f_auto,fl_progressive/v1751889052/xwkchgzzreip4zhzdhen.jpg) you'll know where to fix it 


I'll use Firebase database as my database to store users login information.. meaning the user must login or signup..the the user login information will be saved as records in firebase like I'll create collection and documents not through authentication..then when the user logs in he can see Welcome Back with his/her  name....meaning all these information will be stored on firebase then I'll use render.com as my server... 
So in render environment variables I'll create a key;

 firebase _config

Meaning I'll download the firebase details and paste the entire details on render environment variables keys.

In firebase I've created the following;
1. Collection ID: users
2. Document ID: (Auto-generated by firebase)
3. Fields include;
    a. name (type- string)
    b. email (type- string)
    c. Password (type- string)
     d. createdAt (type- timestamp)

Then it should be a simple app with few codes... 

This site is mostly development due to Med-A app so ensure it appears the first one written, Recommended for KMTC students (medical students)

Use beautiful Google fonts, colors, animations..make it appealing

If we create another education app we'll post it there and that where we'll be posting our news..

It will have a bottom menu with 

1.Home button -where the Apps will be found 
2. News - for now you'll include news about Med-A I'll change when I need..
3. About - this will include the screenshots of Med-A how it looks they include;
